# x-compositing-wm

Extremely basic X11 compositing window manager written in C with Xlib and OpenGL.

## Disclaimer

This is very much *not* intended for use, but merely as a tool to (hopefully) help understand how to write an X11 compositing window manager better than what the quite frankly pisspoor documentation provides.
As such, many best practices are not employed, and a lot of features you'd want to implement aren't implemented (list near the end of this document).

I may or may not end up updating this with these features, but I welcome any pull requests you might have!
